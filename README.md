Chess - a little typescript framework
=====================================

Chess is a framework for creating single page javascript applications. This is NOT MVC framework. All idea behind Chess is declarative layout of reusable components. Chess is written in typescript and depends on Require.js and Zepto.js (or JQuery).

See [aganzha.github.io/chess/][] for an extended introduction, downloads
and documentation.
